<blockquote>
  <p>Workshop at the Linguistic Institute 2011: Language in the World<br />
University of Colorado at Boulder<br />
Wednesday, July 13th, 2011</p>

  <p>This single day workshop aims to build connections between computational, experimental, and grammar-based research on phonetics and phonology. Studies using each of these general methodologies often have similar goals and produce mutually informing results, but they are usually presented in distinct journals and conferences, creating a barrier to their integration. The workshop brings together researchers in the areas of speech production, speech perception, and modeling of language acquisition.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>‘The Balance Between the Gradient and the Discrete in Language Production’:</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>Information-Theoretic Approaches to Linguistics</strong> <br />
<a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/LSA2011/workshops/WS5.html">Conference Website</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wide range of research has shown that tools from information theory (e.g. information content/surprisal, entropy) are useful tools in addressing questions of linguistic interest. These range from predicting the targets and outcomes of phonological and syntactic processes, to explaining the cognitive bases for these processes, to evaluating models of linguistic data. A two-day NSF-funded workshop will bring together a number of researchers working on information-theoretic approaches to linguistics in an effort to share knowledge, tools, insights, and specific research findings. There will also be a tutorial on information theory for those not familiar with the approach. The tutorial will be followed by invited talks and a poster session.</p>

  <p>Invited Speakers:</p>

  <p>Petar Milin, University of Novi Sad, Serbia<br />
John Goldsmith, University of Chicago<br />
John Hale, Cornell University<br />
Kathleen Currie Hall, CUNY: College of Staten Island &amp; The Graduate Center<br />

Notification of acceptance: <del>June 15</del> July 15 2011.</p>

<p>The second conference on Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Prosody (ETAP) is taking place this coming September 23-25 at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. A special focus of this year’s ETAP are contextual influences on prosody. Examining the effects of context on the prosody of an utterance - for example, the context-dependent changes in the duration and prominence of different words or the grouping of words into larger prosodic/meaning units - provides a powerful tool for understanding syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and discourse-level factors and their interplay in language production and comprehension. This conference aims at bringing together researchers from different disciplines who work on these issues.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/lahiri">Aditi Lahiri</a> (Oxford University): WORDS: asymmetries in representation, processing and change</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:<br />
Language systems abound in asymmetries — in inventories, representations and rules. These asymmetries affect language processing and language change. For instance, it is most unusual to have equal number of consonant and vowel phonemes in any given language; languages has retroflex nasals also include dental/alveolar nasals.Velar obstruents become coronals in the context of high front vowels, but never the other way around; nuclear phrasal stress in a neutral sentence is always assigned on the last phonological phrase, never the first one. The question we raise in this talk is how are these asymmetries constrain phonological and morphological representations of WORDS in the mental lexicon, and how these constraints affect language processing and change. I will address asymmetries in various phonological domains: featural contrasts, morphophonological opacity and sentence phonology, providing theoretical and experimental evidence from behavioural as well as brain imaging studies in German, English and Bengali, covering both language comprehension as well language production planning.</p>

      <p>Talking about crowdsourcing, this looks like it’s going to be an interesting workshop at <a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/LSA2011/">this years LSA institute</a>:</p>

<p><em>Full Title: Crowdsourcing Technologies for Language and Cognition</em></p>

<p>Date: 27-Jul-2011 - 27-Jul-2011<br />
Location: Boulder, Colorado, USA<br />
Contact Person: Robert Munro<br />
Web Site: http://www.crowdscientist.com/workshop/</p>

<p>Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics</p>

<p>Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2011</p>

<p>Meeting Description:</p>

<p>This workshop will bring together linguists who are utilizing crowdsourcing technologies and those who want to know more about them. It combines a half-day ‘how-to’ session where participants will learn to conduct experiments using crowdsourcing platforms and a half-day workshop where researchers come together to share results, ideas, and strategies.</p>

<p>It is being held in conjunction with the 2011 LSA Summer Institute.</p>

<p>Call for Papers:</p>

<p>We are eliciting abstract submissions for afternoon presentations. They should present either:</p>

<p>a) Novel empirical results in linguistics or the language sciences that have been enabled by internet-based crowdsourcing technologies, or b) novel approaches to data collection and evaluation, especially when there are no ‘correct’ responses to a given stimuli. Crowdsourcing technologies could include technologies like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, CrowdFlower, online games, collaborative platforms like instant messaging and Wikipedia, or custom software built for collecting language and cognition data. Talk slots will be 10-15 minutes, depending on scheduling.</p>

<p>Please send 250-word abstracts to crowdscientistgmail.com by March 1st, 2011. Do not include author names or affiliations in the abstracts as reviewing will be blind (but list the authors and affiliations in the email itself). Abstracts can be in plain text or PDF. You may optionally include figures, tables and/or references. They will not count towards the 250 words, but please limit the entire submission to one page.</p>

      <p>Malcolm Gladwell has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_gladwell">an interesting article about college education rankings in the current New Yorker</a>. The problem with college rankings, he argues, is that they try to accomplish too much at the same time: rank very different institutions along multiple dimensions. The effect is that decisions about the weighting of the different factors lead to very different rankings, and it is the interests or ideological biases of those who conduct the study and determine the weights.</p>

      <p>Three weeks ago me and a good friend were standing  in front a piece of art by  <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/jon_pylypchuk.htm">Jon Pylypchuck</a>  at the <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/index.html">museum of contemporary art</a> in Montréal. The <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/expositions/89.html">exhibition</a> is still on until January 4th, and I recommend checking it out.</p>
<p><img src="/lab/assets/images/2010/12/frown.jpg" alt="faces" /></p>
<p>So looking at one of the faces, my friend asked the following question, which to me was very confusing: </p>
<p>"Do you think this is a frown or a moustache?"</p>
