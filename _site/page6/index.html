      <p>This year, we are once again organizing a session of the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad, to be held at McGill on January 31. This is a fun competition that is a great way for us get some high school and cegep students (up to 12th grade) exposed to the field of linguistics. If you know of anyone who’d be interested, please forward this message.</p>

<p>Participation is free. No previous knowledge is required. More information and many practice problems are posted at the <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/">naclo website</a>.</p>

<p>If you know any students at high schools or cegeps in the Montréal area who might be interested, please forward them this information. Students can register online until January 30 at 3pm, and we also accept walk-ins on the day of the contest.</p>

<p>The first round of the contest will take place on Thursday, Januar 31, from 10am to 1pm at McGill University (sign in starting at 9:15am; directions can be found at our website (see below). Students who perform well on the first round will be invited back for a second round, to take place on March 13. The winners of the invitational round will be eligible to represent North America at the International Linguistics Olympiad.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/events/upcoming-events/olympiad-2013">McGill Website</a> for more information, or contact us at naclo.montreal@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Note: Currently the North American Olympiad is only held in English. If you are interested in developing materials in French for future years, we can put you in touch with the organizers of NACLO, who expressed interest in trying to make materials available in French as well.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01690965.2011.607713">This paper</a> (which went online at the journal site a year ago) has now officially appeared:</p>

<p>Michael Wagner (2012). A givenness illusion. <em>Language and Cognitive Processes</em> 27 (10). 1433–1458</p>

<p>*Constituents that encode information that is salient in the discourse or “given” are often prosodically reduced and remain unaccented. What is given and new is usually defined at the level of meaning: given expressions are those that refer to salient referents or predicates that have been made salient by the previous discourse. This paper presents evidence from two production studies that sometimes, a constituent that semantically should be contrastive, and hence accentable, is treated prosodically as if it was given, and placing an accent on it is consistently avoided—an illusory case of givenness. This effect can be explained by assuming that givenness is not only evaluated in terms of semantic content, but also at the phonological level. Prosodically marking a semantic contrast requires the presence of a phonological contrast. This effect thus provides evidence that the notion of “antecedent” relevant for prosodic givenness-marking needs to include reference to linguistic form, and not just to referential meaning.**</p>

<p>And while we’re at it, also congratulations to four alumni’s from our labs who are now going to graduate school in various Linguistics programs: Eric Doty (now going for a Ph.D. to UPenn), Aron Hirsch (now going for a Ph.D. to MIT), Alex Piwowarek (now going for an M.A. to Saarbrücken, Germany), and Anna Prokofieva (going to do a degree in Computer Science at Columbia).</p>

Here’s the ABC of his visit:</p>

<p>A. Invited Talk at ETAP2:</p>

<p>Saturday, September 24<br />
9:00-9:30am New Residence, Ballroom B (<a href="prosodylab.org/etap/venue">directions</a>)</p>

<p>Daniel Büring: Correspondence at the Syntax–Phonology Interface<br />
(joint work with Hubert Truckenbrodt, ZAS, Berlin)</p>

<p>*Abstract: In this paper we analyze the syntax-to-prosody mapping in German and English using Correspondence Theory. Our proposal develops the original ideas of containment based mapping theories like Truckenbrodt’s (1995) StressXP/WrapXP and is offshoots such as Selkirk’s (2009) recent Match theory, but tackles a number of notorious problems for these, in particular the interaction of stress assignment and movement, as well as directional asymmetries with predicate integration as well as focus. We argue that the correspondence theoretic format offers distinctive advantages in these realms.**</p>

      <p>Shifting prominence to mark focus requires a linguistic antecedent, so if you say ‘A <strong>red</strong> apple’, chances are you or someone either said something like ‘ <strong>green</strong> apple’, or there is some other reason why antecedents of this sort are salient, for example, someone might have asked: What kind of apple do you want?</p>

<p>Marking focus is a bit like using pronouns and other anaphoras: While there must be a proper antecedent to resolve the reference to interpret anaphoras, for focus there must be a proper antecedent to justify the contrast. Pronouns can also be used cataphorically, where the antecedent for the reference comes after the pronoun–and the same is true for focus marking.</p>

<p>Here’s a nice exploitation of our grammatical knowledge that focus marking requires a linguistic antecedent from September 15’s Colbert report:</p>

<iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XqSwNQnQIPI?hl=en&amp;fs=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Colbert is using focus cataphorically to set up an expectation for an antecedent, and then leaves us hanging in mid air. There are a number of papers at the upcoming <a href="http://prosodylab.org/etap">etap</a> conference that address focus marking and its use in context.</p>

      <p>if you’d like to get a digest emails with posts to this blog, you can subscribe to it <a href="&lt;a href=">here</a> (or use the link in the sidebar). This is a low traffic blog with prosody-related posts. Some of the information posted here is about local events, and I haven’t figured out how to allow readers who don’t live in Montréal to filter these out of the digest emails, so if you subscribe to the email you might get some of these.</p>
