      <p>The next <a href="http://www.issp2011.uqam.ca">International Seminar on Speech Production</a> will take place next summer in Montreal. Here’s the call for papers:</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to announce that the the ninth International Seminar on Speech Production (ISSP’11) will be held in Montreal, Canada from June 20th to 23rd, 2011. ISSP’11 is the continuation of a series of seminars dating back to Grenoble (1988), Leeds (1990), Old Saybrook (1993), Autrans (1996), Kloster Seeon (2000), Sydney (2003), Ubatuba (2006), and Strasbourg (2008). Several aspects of speech production will be covered, such as phonology, phonetics, linguistics, mechanics, acoustics, physiology, motor control, neurosciences and computer science.</em></p>

<p>For this edition, a special session will be organized in honor of Dr. Joseph Perkell, for his contribution to the field.</p>

<p>THE DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION IS December 15th, 2010. Technical details will be posted soon on the conference website (<a href="http://www.issp2011.uqam.ca">www.issp2011.uqam.ca</a>).</p>

      <p>There is an interesting series of articles in the new york times on the benefits and dangers of using large-scale corpora and statistical methods in the analysis of literary and other texts in the humanities. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/arts/17digital.html">The first</a> discusses some projects that are part of the <a href="http://prosodylab.org/?p=1">digging-into-data challenge</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/books/04victorian.html">The second article</a> illustrates what race horses with conspicuous names can teach us about the pitfalls of the new windfall of data (hat-tip to Kate McCurdy).</p>

      <p>A <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504320/">movie</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom#World_War_II">King George VI</a> is soon to be released in North America (December 10 in Canada), which centers around his stammer, and his successful way of dealing with it in a job that turned out to require lot of public speaking. He worked with speech pathologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Logue">Lionel Logue</a> to overcome the problem. You can listen to a recording of a famous Christmas address of his given in 1939 <a href="http://archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/12/25/">here</a> (it takes a little while before the recording starts playing).</p>

      <p>It’s hard not to think of the acquisition of non-native phonological contrasts when reading about the research on London cab-drivers described <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-skilled-are-london-taxi-drivers-at.html">here</a> (well, if you’re a linguist, that is). I found the blog post via a discussion of the study <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/the-cognitive-cost-of-expertise/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, London cab-drivers are better at learning new routes than a control group when the new route is located in an unfamiliar city, but they have a harder time learning a new route than a control group when it is located in London, and thus competes with their previous knowledege. This latter effect seems similar to the observation that it’s harder to learn a new phonological contrast after having already learned a language, compared to when acquiring a first language.</p>

<p>Various people have indeed argued that our ability to learn new types of phonological contrasts might deteriorate not (just) because we are past a critical period of brain development, but (also) because after having learned our first language(s), it’s become harder to fit new contrasts into our existing ‘map.’ By having learned a language we might have developed “an inability to inhibit access to existing (and now competing) memory representations,” to quote from the blog post on cab drivers. This idea is advocated here:</p>

<p><a href="dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00198-1">Kuhl, P. K. (2000). Language, mind, and brain: Experience alters perception. In M. S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), The new cognitive neurosciences (2nd ed.) (pp. 99-115). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</a></p>

<p>Perhaps one could test whether there is really a parallel between the results found for cab-drivers and language learners by comparing how well we can learn a particular new contrast when it’s presented as part of a very different language as opposed to as part of a different dialect of our native language. The latter should actually be more difficult, if the parallel would hold up, although one would somehow have to control for the familiarity with the lexical material. And I guess there should be less of an issue in learning a new gestural contrast in a sign language if you’ve only learned a spoken languages before, compared to having previous knowledge in a sign language. Maybe someone has already tested this?</p>

      <p>When: May 7-9 2011<br />
Where: McGill University</p>

<p><em>‘Phonology in the 21st Century: In Honour of Glyne Piggott’ is a conference to honour Glyne Piggott, who retired in May 2010 from McGill University. For over forty years, Prof. Piggott has been a supporter of the highest quality research in phonology. He is well recognized for maintaining the most rigorous approach to theory building and testing, coupled with intellectual breadth and curiosity. He instills in those around him the need to have a wide perspective on thinking in the field, and challenges his students to become independent scholars who will survive the theoretical whims of the time. Although the conference is organized to honour Prof. Piggott, its theoretical objective is to highlight phonological research at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, evaluating the contributions of the past forty years in light of the primary theoretical and empirical concerns of today.</em></p>
