      <p>The <a href="http://www.wccfl2010.org/home.htm">WCCFL</a> program has been posted. There’s lots of interesting papers on prosody on the program, including some from <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/">McGill</a>: by David-Etienne Bouchard (on clitic in French), Öner Öçelik and Miho Nagai (Syntax-Prosody in Turkish), Hyekyung Hwang, Moti Lieberman, <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/people/goad/">Heather Goad</a>, &amp; <a href="http://webpages.mcgill.ca/staff/group2/lwhite/web/">Lydia White</a> (on prosodic diambiguation), Walter Pederson (on ‘again’), and yet another one by Heather Goad and Lydia White (on prosodic transfer). There’s also a talk by Nikola Predolac, who is just finishing his thesis at <a href="http://ling.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a>, on givenness and the scope of focus operators in Serbian. Lots of other interesting prosody stuff on the program, including an invited talk by <a href="http://s.psych.uiuc.edu/people/showprofile.php?id=546">Duane Watson</a>. Can’t believe I can’t go…</p>

      <p><a href="http://speechprosody2010.illinois.edu/">Speech Prosody</a> will take place in Chicago this year.

<p>prosodylab will be represented at speech prosody with two posters in the main session. drop me an email if you’re interested in the drafts:</p>

<p>M. Wagner, M. Breen, E. Flemming, S. Shattuck-Hufnagel, &amp; E. Gibson: Prosodic Effects of Discourse Salience and Association with Focus.</p>

<p><em>Abtract: Three factors that have been argued to influence the prosody of<br />
an utterance are (i) which constituents encode discourse-salient<br />
information; (ii) which constituents are contrastive in that they<br />
evoke alternatives; and (iii) which constituents interact with<br />
the meaning of focus operators such as only (i.e., they ‘associate’<br />
with focus). One challenge for a better understanding of<br />
these factors has been the difficulty of finding a way to evaluate<br />
hypotheses quantitatively, since individual variation in productions<br />
is often large enough to wash out experimental effects.<br />
In this paper, we apply a methodology introduced in [1] which<br />
regresses out subject and item variation, uncovering otherwise<br />
hidden prosodic patterns that illustrate how the three factors interact<br />
in sentences containing single or multiple foci.</em></p>

<p>Wagner, Michael &amp; Serena Crivellaro: Relative Prosodic Boundary Strength and Prior Bias in Disambiguation</p>

<p><em>Abstract: Previous research found that the relative rather than the absolute<br />
size of prosodic boundaries is crucial in disambiguating<br />
attachment ambiguities [1, 2]. Furthermore, relative categorical<br />
differences matter whereas merely quantitative ones do not<br />
[1]. This paper presents further evidence that relative boundary<br />
strength is indeed what is crucial, but, contrary to earlier findings,<br />
gradient quantitative differences in boundary rank affect<br />
parsing decisions in gradient ways. Furthermore, varying the<br />
plausibility of a given reading in a given context shifts the perceptual<br />
boundaries between different phrasings such that quantitatively<br />
stronger prosodic cues are necessary to counter-act a<br />
prior bias against it.</em></p>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago my article “Prosody and Recursion in Coordinate Structures and Beyond” was <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/43t2jp7h5p131tw8/?p=caf08a6d61f549c6b5bef6e1f8dcb8a0&amp;pi=2">posted online</a> by <em>Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</em>. Here’s the abstract:</p>

<p><em>Generalizations about relative prosodic boundary strength are recursive. Initial evidence comes from the fragment of English consisting only of proper names and and and or. A systematic relation between the semantics, the syntactic combinatorics, and the prosodic phrasing of coordinate structures can be captured by recursively building up their prosody, in tandem with assembling their compositional meaning. Alternative edge-based approaches to prosodic phrasing fail to capture the recursive nature of the generalization, a result independent of whether or not prosodic representation itself is assumed to be recursive. The pattern generalizes beyond the grammar of coordination, despite two types of apparent counterexamples: Structures that are prosodically flat but syntactically articulated, and structures with an apparent outright mismatch between prosody and syntax. Closer inspection suggests that the syntax might actually be quite in tune with prosody. In both cases, natural language employs strategies to construe complex meaning with list-like structures rather than nested ones. The privileged status of lists may be due to processing factors.</em></p>

      <p><em>[see also a more recent post <a href="http://prosodylab.org/?p=459">here</a>. mw, august 8 2010</em>]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?snedekerlab.html">Kate McCurdy</a> and I are currently working on cross-linguistic differences in constraints on rhyme. Here’s a draft of a recent <a href="http://prosodylab.org/~chael/www/wagnermccurdy09_draft.pdf">paper</a> that proposes an explanation for why ‘identity’ rhyme is considered a satisfactory rhyme in French but not in English. We relate this difference to the way information structure affects prosody in those languages, drawing on an observation by Edwin Williams that suggests that focus- and givenness marking in English has been ‘overgeneralized’ to phonological identity in such a way that sentences can sound infelicitous just because they end with phonological identical material.</p>

<p>A rhyme is usually defined as a pair of words that are identical from the last accented vowel to the end of the word or line (wear/bear). Identity rhyme (or: rime très riche) is a rhyme pair in which the phonological material from the accented syllable including the onset until the end of the word or line are identical (to bear/a bear). A special case are homophones, in which the entire last words containing the last accented vowel of the line are identical. In our study we focus on rhymes that are phonologically identical but differ in meaning, because rhymes that are identical in phonology and meaning might be bad because they’re repetitious. Identity rhyme is different from mere ‘rime riche,’ in which an additional consonant is shared, but the rhymes are not fully identical (train, crane). While identity rhymes are considered poor and are rare in languages such as English or German, rime riche is quite well attested. In some other languages, French is one example, identity rhymes are ubiquitous. Of course, it could well be that this is an accidental differences stemming from the different poetic traditions in these languages, but our working hypothesis is that there is more to this.</p>

<p>A simple illustration of the cross-linguistic differences: One way we try to compare usage of rhyme across languages is to look translations of rhymed poetry. We have been collecting translations of the illustrated children’s book ‘Max &amp; Moritz’ by Wilhelm Busch (first published in German in 1865).</p>
