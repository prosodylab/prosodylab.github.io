I"É<p>if youâ€™d like to get a digest emails with posts to this blog, you can subscribe to it <a href="&lt;a href=">here</a> (or use the link in the sidebar). This is a low traffic blog with prosody-related posts. Some of the information posted here is about local events, and I havenâ€™t figured out how to allow readers who donâ€™t live in MontrÃ©al to filter these out of the digest emails, so if you subscribe to the email you might get some of these.</p>
