I"û<p>In case anyone is still worried that texting abbreviations are a sign that the English language is deteriorating they should have a look at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/aug/18/british-library-textspeak-exhibition">article in the Guardian</a> a few days ago about an upcoming <a href="http://www.bl.uk/evolvingenglish/">exhibition on language</a> at the British Library in London, which provides evidence that these abbreviations are actually a time-honored tradition of playful language/orthography use. Among other things the exhibition revisits the history of language <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1354">peevery</a>, it seems, with such landmarks as Jonathan Swift‚Äôs <a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/proposal.html">A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue</a>. One of the many grievances Jonathan Swift had with his fellow English users was <em>that barbarous Custom of abbreviating Words</em>. Swift would surely not have been amused by the poetic use of things like ‚ÄúI wrote 2U B4‚Äù in an 19th century poem the exhibition features. Anatol Stefanowitsch, whose <a href="http://www.wissenslogs.de/wblogs/blog/sprachlog">blog</a> post pointed me to this, dug up the complete poem referred to in the article, <a href="http://www.wissenslogs.de/wblogs/blog/sprachlog/sprachgebrauch/2010-08-22/sms-k-rzel-im-19.-jahrhundert">Essay to Miss Catharine Jay</a>, as it was published in 1847. Some of the ‚Äòemblems‚Äô are not easy to resolve, have a look‚Ä¶ The one that Anatol is wondering about in his post is ‚ÄòThe girl without a parallel‚Äô as a girl without a parallel pointed out to me.</p>
