I"£<p><a href="http://www.danielgoodhue.com/">Dan Goodhue</a> just filed the final version of his awsome doctoral thesis: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003956">Asking and answering biased polar questions</a></p>

<p><em>This dissertation explores how the interpretation of polar questions and answers to them is affected by prosody and negation. Phenomena analyzed include polar questions with polarity focus (prominence on the auxiliary), negative polar questions, yes/no responses to positive and negative polar questions, and the intonations used in such yes/no responses <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003956">â€¦</a></em></p>

<p>Congratulations, Dan!</p>
