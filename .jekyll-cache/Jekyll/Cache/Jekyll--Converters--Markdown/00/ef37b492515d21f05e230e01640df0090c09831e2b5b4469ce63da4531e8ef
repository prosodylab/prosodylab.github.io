<p><em>A full description of our knowledge of language must include reference to several different components, each with its own particular properties. These components must interact with each other, and with a lexicon, which we may think of as a system of stored associations between pieces of information pertaining to many of the above components. In recent years, the study of the interaction between these different levels of linguistic knowledge has attracted increasing interest. The nature and extent of the interaction of different linguistic modules is a central question to be addressed by a modern theory of linguistic knowledge.</em></p>
