The aim of the conference is to bring together psychological, computational, and theoretical perspectives on the cognitive mechanisms which underlie any aspect of human language processing. Submissions which integrate experimental psycholinguistic evidence with formal or computational models of psychological processes are especially encouraged.</em></p>
