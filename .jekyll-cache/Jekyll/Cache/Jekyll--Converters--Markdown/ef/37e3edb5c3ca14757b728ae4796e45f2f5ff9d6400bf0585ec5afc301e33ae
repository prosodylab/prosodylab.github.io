<blockquote>
  <p>Workshop at the Linguistic Institute 2011: Language in the World<br />
University of Colorado at Boulder<br />
Wednesday, July 13th, 2011</p>

  <p>This single day workshop aims to build connections between computational, experimental, and grammar-based research on phonetics and phonology. Studies using each of these general methodologies often have similar goals and produce mutually informing results, but they are usually presented in distinct journals and conferences, creating a barrier to their integration. The workshop brings together researchers in the areas of speech production, speech perception, and modeling of language acquisition.</p>

  <p>Spoken Sessions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>â€˜The Balance Between the Gradient and the Discrete in Language Productionâ€™:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Gary Dell (U Illinois Urbana Champaign), â€˜Implicit Learning of Artificial Phonotactic Patterns in the Production System: Connections to the Perceptual System and to Real Phonotactic Knowledgeâ€™<br />
Matt Goldrick (Northwestern), â€˜Gradient Symbol Processing in Speech Productionâ€™</p>

  <ul>
    <li>â€˜Listener Adaptation to Variationâ€™:</li>

<p><strong>Information-Theoretic Approaches to Linguistics</strong> <br />
<a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/LSA2011/workshops/WS5.html">Conference Website</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wide range of research has shown that tools from information theory (e.g. information content/surprisal, entropy) are useful tools in addressing questions of linguistic interest. These range from predicting the targets and outcomes of phonological and syntactic processes, to explaining the cognitive bases for these processes, to evaluating models of linguistic data. A two-day NSF-funded workshop will bring together a number of researchers working on information-theoretic approaches to linguistics in an effort to share knowledge, tools, insights, and specific research findings. There will also be a tutorial on information theory for those not familiar with the approach. The tutorial will be followed by invited talks and a poster session.</p>
