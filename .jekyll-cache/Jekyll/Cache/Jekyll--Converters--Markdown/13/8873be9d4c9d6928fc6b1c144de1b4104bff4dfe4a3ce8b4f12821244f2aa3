I"¹<p>This year, we are once again organizing a session of the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad, to be held at McGill on January 31. This is a fun competition that is a great way for us get some high school and cegep students (up to 12th grade) exposed to the field of linguistics. If you know of anyone whoâ€™d be interested, please forward this message.</p>

<p>Participation is free. No previous knowledge is required. More information and many practice problems are posted at the <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/">naclo website</a>.</p>

<p>If you know any students at high schools or cegeps in the MontrÃ©al area who might be interested, please forward them this information. Students can register online until January 30 at 3pm, and we also accept walk-ins on the day of the contest.</p>

<p>The first round of the contest will take place on Thursday, Januar 31, from 10am to 1pm at McGill University (sign in starting at 9:15am; directions can be found at our website (see below). Students who perform well on the first round will be invited back for a second round, to take place on March 13. The winners of the invitational round will be eligible to represent North America at the International Linguistics Olympiad.</p>
