I"Ó<p>There have been two interesting blog posts on scientific literacy recently on the <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com">bps digest</a>. <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/10/five-minutes-with-discoverer-of.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BpsResearchDigest+%28BPS+Research+Digest%29">The first</a> addresses how to present findings in ways that minimizes a â€˜scientific impotence response,â€™ where people discard scientific findings because they are incompatible with their world view by resorting to claiming that a certain topic cannot be properly studied scientifically. <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/11/can-psychology-help-combat.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BpsResearchDigest+%28BPS+Research+Digest%29">The second</a> post discusses how one can try to present findings effectively in order to debunk pseudo-scientific beliefs.</p>
