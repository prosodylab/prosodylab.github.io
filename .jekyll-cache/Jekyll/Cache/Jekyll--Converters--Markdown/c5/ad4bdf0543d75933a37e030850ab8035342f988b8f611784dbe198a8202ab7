I"9<p>Malcolm Gladwell has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_gladwell">an interesting article about college education rankings in the current New Yorker</a>. The problem with college rankings, he argues, is that they try to accomplish too much at the same time: rank very different institutions along multiple dimensions. The effect is that decisions about the weighting of the different factors lead to very different rankings, and it is the interests or ideological biases of those who conduct the study and determine the weights.</p>
