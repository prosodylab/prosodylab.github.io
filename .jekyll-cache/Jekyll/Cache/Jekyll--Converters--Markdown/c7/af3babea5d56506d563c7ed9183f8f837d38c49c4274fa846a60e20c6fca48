<p><em>‘Phonology in the 21st Century: In Honour of Glyne Piggott’ is a conference to honour Glyne Piggott, who retired in May 2010 from McGill University. For over forty years, Prof. Piggott has been a supporter of the highest quality research in phonology. He is well recognized for maintaining the most rigorous approach to theory building and testing, coupled with intellectual breadth and curiosity. He instills in those around him the need to have a wide perspective on thinking in the field, and challenges his students to become independent scholars who will survive the theoretical whims of the time. Although the conference is organized to honour Prof. Piggott, its theoretical objective is to highlight phonological research at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, evaluating the contributions of the past forty years in light of the primary theoretical and empirical concerns of today.</em></p>
