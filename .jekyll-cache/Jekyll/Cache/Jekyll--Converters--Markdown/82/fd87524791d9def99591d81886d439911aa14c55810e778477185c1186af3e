I"º<p>For those of you who are interested in using the<a href="http://prosodylab.org/tools/aligner/">Prosodylab Aligner</a> and are new to using Unix and/or Terminal on your computer, weâ€™ve started making a series of video tutorials to show you how to use this software on your own. The videos will cover some basics and not-so-basics, from how to run the Aligner through Terminal to how to clean and prepare your data for training the Aligner on new models.</p>

<p>First in the series is an intro to the Aligner: what is it, what does it do, and how can you run it?</p>
