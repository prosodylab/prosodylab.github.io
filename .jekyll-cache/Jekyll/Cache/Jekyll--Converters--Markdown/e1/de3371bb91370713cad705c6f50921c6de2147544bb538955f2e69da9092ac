<p>The second conference on Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Prosody (ETAP) is taking place this coming September 23-25 at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. A special focus of this year’s ETAP are contextual influences on prosody. Examining the effects of context on the prosody of an utterance - for example, the context-dependent changes in the duration and prominence of different words or the grouping of words into larger prosodic/meaning units - provides a powerful tool for understanding syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and discourse-level factors and their interplay in language production and comprehension. This conference aims at bringing together researchers from different disciplines who work on these issues.</p>
