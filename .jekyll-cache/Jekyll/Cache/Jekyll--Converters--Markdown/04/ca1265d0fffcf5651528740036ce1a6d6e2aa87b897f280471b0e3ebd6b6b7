I"#<p>Next time you’re walking out of a German supermarket with 302 items hidden in your coat that you didn’t pay for and you are faced with some uncomfortable questions by a security guard try the following: say that the suspicion of theft is absurd. Then, after your loot has been tallied by the security guard, admit that there may have been a few mistakes in your shopping procedure, but that you were incredibly busy thinking of other stuff, and stick to your original claim that the suspicion of deliberate theft remains an absurd one.</p>
