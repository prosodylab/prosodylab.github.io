I"Ç<p>The special issue of <em>Language and Cognitive Processes</em> with contribution from the 2008 conference <a href="http://www.prosodylab.org/~chael/www/etap/">Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Prosody</a> has <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g927683184">appeared online</a>:</p>

<p><em>Prosody is the rhythm, stress and intonation of speech, which encodes information that is not encoded by the syntax or words of an utterance. Prosody is critical for parsing speech, constructing syntactic structure, and building a representation of the conversational discourse model, among other linguistic functions.</em></p>

<p>In 2008, researchers from linguistics, psychology and computer science gathered at the inaugural meeting of the conference on Experimental and Theoretical Approaches to Prosody at Cornell University. The papers in this volume represent the cutting edge of the prosody work presented at that conference.</p>
