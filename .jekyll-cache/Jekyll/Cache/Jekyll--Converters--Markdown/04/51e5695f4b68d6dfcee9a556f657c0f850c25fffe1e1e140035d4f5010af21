I"5	<p>Three weeks ago me and a good friend were standing  in front a piece of art by  <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/jon_pylypchuk.htm">Jon Pylypchuck</a>  at the <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/index.html">museum of contemporary art</a> in Montr√©al. The <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/expositions/89.html">exhibition</a> is still on until January 4th, and I recommend checking it out.</p>

<p>So looking at one of the faces, my friend asked the following question, which to me was very confusing: </p>
<p>"Do you think this is a frown or a moustache?"</p>
<p>Whatever 'this' was, it was clearly below the eyes, and also, the facial expression was sad--so how could it be a frown? My understanding of <em>frown</em> was what I later found in <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frown?show=1&amp;t=1292553539">Webster's  online dictionary</a>:</p>
<p>1 : an expression of displeasure<br />
2 : a wrinkling of the brow in displeasure or concentration</p>
<p>When I expressed my puzzlement, I learned that <em>frown</em>, in fact, also means the opposite of smile: a downward facing mouth expressing sadness, and that this is in fact the most common/salient meaning of the word, at least to some. What I found astonishing about this is that after ten years of living in North America I would have such a different notion of <em>frown</em>, especially since the second meaning expresses a completely different emotion---I think it's rare that one is wrong about the basic emotion that a word stands for, there's just usually a lot of information about what emotion is intended to be expressed in the context. </p>
<p>The sad and mouth-oriented reading of frown seems a recent development, at least it doesn't seem to have made it into any dictionaries that I consulted. Charles Darwin, who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bHWJQ2XaKUYC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22frown%22&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=%22frown%22&amp;f=false">wrote about</a> frowns in <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em>, clearly didn't think of the mouth when thinking of frowning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The currogators, by their contraction, lower the eyebrows and bring them together, producing vertical furrows on the forehead---
that is, a frown.
