I"ç<p>I was about to write <em>if worse comes to worst</em> in an email, and then realized that Iâ€™m actually not sure what the correct idiom exactly is. The difference between <em>worse</em> and <em>worst</em> is hard to hear, and itâ€™s not so clear that it has a transparent compositional meaning, so neither sound nor meaning really help. A quick Google vote seemed to resolve this, but not in an entirely crisp way:</p>

<p>â€œworst comes to worstâ€ â€“ 149.000 hits<br />
â€œworse comes to worstâ€ â€“ 47.800 hits<br />
â€œworst comes to worseâ€ â€“ 578.000 hits<br />
â€œworse comes to worseâ€ â€“ 7.370.00 hits</p>

<p>So I went with â€˜worse comes to worse.â€™ However, the <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA965&amp;dq=%22worst+comes+to+worst%22+merriam+webster&amp;ei=vghxS5XUHaa8zgSUiNSJDg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Merriam Websterâ€™s Dictionary of English usage</a> states that the original phrase is â€˜if the worst comes to the worst,â€™ first used in 1597, and then goes to say that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[â€¦] presumably, it was the desire to make the phrase more logical that gave rise to the variant <em>if the worse comes to the worst</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure exactly how thatâ€™s more logical, but I guess that was my first intuition too. At any rate, this version was first recorded in Dafoeâ€™s 1719â€™s Robinson Crusoe and has become wide-spread since then. The article concludes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The forms which are most commonly used are <em>if worst comes to worst</em> and <em>if worse comes to worst</em>. There are those who regard the form having <em>worse</em> as incorrect, but its use is too widespread and well established for it to be regarded as anything other than standard. Use of <em>if worse comes to worse</em> is considerably less common, at least in print. The definite articles are now omitted more often than not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things may have changed since the dictionary was published (this is the 1994 edition, I should check a more recent one). <em>Worst comes to worse</em> is not even mentioned, and the Google counts clearly make <em>if worse comes to worse</em> the most frequent. However, there may be some distortions due to the various discussions of what the correct way of saying it is (and people like me are still allowed to post in English on the internet)â€¦ .</p>

<p>One reason why <em>worse comes to worse</em> might be chosen sometimes instead of <em>worse comes to worst</em> is that it (re-)creates a parallelism. But suppose that this innovation leads again to attempts to to make the idiom more â€˜logical.â€™ Then we would expectâ€¦ right:</p>

<p>â€œbad comes to worseâ€ â€“ 59,000 hits<br />
â€œworse comes to badâ€ â€“ 2 hits, one of which is actually â€œworse comes to bad luckâ€</p>

<p>And if this catches one, I guess the step would be to make it more parallel again, and this would lead toâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œbad comes to badâ€ â€“ 5 hits.</p>

<p>Soon to be 6 I guess. So possibly both parallelism and semantically motivated changes are at play in determining how this idiom meanders through its various versionsâ€¦ Or maybe things are simply getting better rather than worse over time?</p>

<p>Update Feb 6 2011: Thought Iâ€™d add a graph from the <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=worst+comes+to+worst,+worse+comes+to+worst,+worse+comes+to+worse,+worst+comes+to+worse&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3">google ngram viewer</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2010/02/worse.jpg" alt="worse" /></p>

<p>The version â€˜worst comes to worstâ€™ is ahead of â€œworse comes to worstâ€ at a pretty steady margin from about the 1880s until world war II, but then and shortly after the overall frequency of the expression is going up (maybe not surprisingly) and itâ€™s â€œworst comes to worstâ€ thatâ€™s driving the effect. Since then, however, â€˜worse comes to worstâ€™ has caught up, and may be taking over, and â€œworse comes to worseâ€ is risingâ€¦</p>
