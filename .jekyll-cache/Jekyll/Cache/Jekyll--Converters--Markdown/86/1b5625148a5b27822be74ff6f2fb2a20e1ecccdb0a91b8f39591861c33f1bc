This is the virtual prosody field station. On this page, we post publicly available experiments you can try out. The experiments explore how we produce and perceive speech, with a particular focus on sentence prosody. You can check these studies out just for fun, without contributing your data, or you can participate for real and volunteer your data. It doesn't matter what's your native language (but if you contribute your data, we'll ask you which languages you speak, so we can evaluate the data accordingly).

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to just check out the experiment just for fun:
    <ul>
      <li>Your data will not be saved</li>
      <li>You will go straight to the experiment, there will be no consent form</li>
      <li>If itâ€™s a recording study, you will still be asked for permission to be recorded, and your browser will record your voice, but we will not download this data, it will stay on your computer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you choose to volunteer your data:
    <ul>
      <li>You will be shown a consent form where you learn more about the study, and about the data we save</li>
      <li>There will be short questionnaires (e.g. a language questionaire) in addition to the main experiment that will help us analyze the data</li>
      <li>If you opt out at any point before the experiment is concluded (just by closing the browser window), your data will not be saved</li>
      <li>At the end of the study, you will be given a completion code. If you write down this code, then you could later email us if you want us to delete your data. If you do not write down this code, then we have no way of telling which data is yours, and we will not be able to find your data and delete if you wanted that to happen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you are looking to participate for a compensation:**
    <ul>
      <li>We currently have no experiments running in our physical lab at McGill</li>
      <li>We currently run online studies on and off at various crowdsourcing websites, including Prolific, Amazon, and Crowdworks. If you sign up, you will find many experiments, but not necessarily one of ours</li>
    </ul>
