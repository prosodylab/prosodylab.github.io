I"ô<p><a href="http://prosodylab.org">prosody.lab</a> and the McGill <a href="http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~meghan.clayards/Research.html">speech learning lab</a> now share a CFI-funded eye-tracking lab with a sound booth, an <a href="http://www.sr-research.com/">eyelink 2000</a> remote desktop eye-tracker and a <a href="http://positivescience.com/">positivescience</a> free-view eye-tracker.</p>

<p>Check out our short clip from our demonstration at this yearâ€™s convocation (this is the first time we used it after our trainging session, so probably we could have gotten a better track with some more experience):</p>
