<p>M. Wagner, M. Breen, E. Flemming, S. Shattuck-Hufnagel, &amp; E. Gibson: Prosodic Effects of Discourse Salience and Association with Focus.</p>

<p><em>Abtract: Three factors that have been argued to influence the prosody of<br />
an utterance are (i) which constituents encode discourse-salient<br />
information; (ii) which constituents are contrastive in that they<br />
evoke alternatives; and (iii) which constituents interact with<br />
the meaning of focus operators such as only (i.e., they â€˜associateâ€™<br />
with focus). One challenge for a better understanding of<br />
these factors has been the difficulty of finding a way to evaluate<br />
hypotheses quantitatively, since individual variation in productions<br />
is often large enough to wash out experimental effects.<br />
In this paper, we apply a methodology introduced in [1] which<br />
regresses out subject and item variation, uncovering otherwise<br />
hidden prosodic patterns that illustrate how the three factors interact<br />
in sentences containing single or multiple foci.</em></p>

<p>Wagner, Michael &amp; Serena Crivellaro: Relative Prosodic Boundary Strength and Prior Bias in Disambiguation</p>

<p><em>Abstract: Previous research found that the relative rather than the absolute<br />
size of prosodic boundaries is crucial in disambiguating<br />
attachment ambiguities [1, 2]. Furthermore, relative categorical<br />
differences matter whereas merely quantitative ones do not<br />
[1]. This paper presents further evidence that relative boundary<br />
strength is indeed what is crucial, but, contrary to earlier findings,<br />
gradient quantitative differences in boundary rank affect<br />
parsing decisions in gradient ways. Furthermore, varying the<br />
plausibility of a given reading in a given context shifts the perceptual<br />
boundaries between different phrasings such that quantitatively<br />
stronger prosodic cues are necessary to counter-act a<br />
prior bias against it.</em></p>
