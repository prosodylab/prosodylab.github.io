I"Ö<p>Three weeks ago me and a good friend were standing  in front a piece of art by  <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/jon_pylypchuk.htm">Jon Pylypchuck</a>  at the <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/index.html">museum of contemporary art</a> in Montr√©al. The <a href="http://www.macm.org/fr/expositions/89.html">exhibition</a> is still on until January 4th, and I recommend checking it out.</p>
<p><img src="/lab/assets/images/2010/12/frown.jpg" alt="faces" /></p>
<p>So looking at one of the faces, my friend asked the following question, which to me was very confusing: </p>
<p>"Do you think this is a frown or a moustache?"</p>
