  <p>Call for papers:<br />
The aim of this workshop is to bring together scientists working in different fields and with different methodologies to discuss the mental representation of verbal argument structure. This topic has been addressed by work in a variety of fields (language and conceptual development, theoretical syntax and semantics, lexicology, linguistic typology, psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, etc.). In this workshop we hope to create a cross-disciplinary platform to discuss ongoing research. We believe that an open exchange between scientists using different methods, working with different populations and within different theoretical frameworks will be of great benefit to the community. To this end we have invited speakers from different fields (language acquisition, neuro-imagery and aphasiology, theoretical syntax, theoretical semantics, sign language), each to be commented upon by a researcher from another discipline. A selection of papers presented in the workshop will be published in a special issue of Recherches linguistiques de Vincennes (RLV).</p>

  <p>We invite submissions for 30min talks. We especially encourage submissions reporting inter-disciplinary (or inter-disciplinary motivated) work but will consider any submission (from any field) dealing with verbal argument structure. Sign language (LSF, BSL, ASL) interpreters will be available. Participation in the workshop is free.</p>

  <p>Abstracts should be not longer than 500 words<br />
