I"<p>I was about to write <em>if worse comes to worst</em> in an email, and then realized that I’m actually not sure what the correct idiom exactly is. The difference between <em>worse</em> and <em>worst</em> is hard to hear, and it’s not so clear that it has a transparent compositional meaning, so neither sound nor meaning really help. A quick Google vote seemed to resolve this, but not in an entirely crisp way:</p>

<p>“worst comes to worst” – 149.000 hits<br />
“worse comes to worst” – 47.800 hits<br />
“worst comes to worse” – 578.000 hits<br />
“worse comes to worse” – 7.370.00 hits</p>

<p>So I went with ‘worse comes to worse.’ However, the <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA965&amp;dq=%22worst+comes+to+worst%22+merriam+webster&amp;ei=vghxS5XUHaa8zgSUiNSJDg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Merriam Webster’s Dictionary of English usage</a> states that the original phrase is ‘if the worst comes to the worst,’ first used in 1597, and then goes to say that</p>
