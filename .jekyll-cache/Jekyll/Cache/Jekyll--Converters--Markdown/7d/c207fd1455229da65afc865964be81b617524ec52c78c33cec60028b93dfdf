I"Ù<p>UPenn is hosting a workshop on <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/workshop/">New tools and methods for very-large-scale phonetics research</a>, on January 28-30, 2011. Hereâ€™s the call for papers:</p>

<p><em>The field of phonetics has experienced two revolutions in the last century: the advent of the sound spectrograph in the 1950s and the application of computers beginning in the 1970s. Today, advances in digital multimedia, networking and mass storage are promising a third revolution: a movement from the study of small, mostly artificial datasets to the analysis of published corpora of natural speech that are thousands of times larger.</em></p>

<p>To welcome and promote this revolution, we will organize a workshop on new tools and methods for Very-Large-Scale phonetics research, as part of a newly awarded NSF grant. The themes of the workshop include: integration of speech technology in phonetics studies; variation and invariance in large speech corpora; and revisiting classic phonetic and phonological problems from the perspective of corpus phonetics. A tutorial on forced alignment and the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner will also be provided prior to the workshop.</p>

<p>Selected papers from the workshop will be published in a special issue of The Journal of Experimental Linguistics.<br />
Important Dates</p>

<p>* Nov. 8, 2010: Abstract submission deadline<br />
 * Jan. 28, 2011: Tutorial on forced alignment<br />
 * Jan. 29-30, 2011: Workshop</p>
