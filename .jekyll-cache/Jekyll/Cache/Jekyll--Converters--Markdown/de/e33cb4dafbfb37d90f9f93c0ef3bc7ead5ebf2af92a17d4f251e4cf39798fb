I"K<p>A post on <a href="http://mindhacks.com/2010/12/01/im-not-waiting-for-inspiration-its-waiting-for-me/">mindhacks</a> reports on a 1974 study on writer’s block, <a href="http://mindhacks.com/2010/12/08/unsuccessful-treatment-of-writers-block-a-replication/">replicated</a> in 2007. The study has a lot of parallels with Fiengo &amp; Lasnik’s 1972 squib in Linguistic Inquiry on unrecoverable deletion in syntax. I wonder in how many fields similar studies were published, and when it started.</p>
