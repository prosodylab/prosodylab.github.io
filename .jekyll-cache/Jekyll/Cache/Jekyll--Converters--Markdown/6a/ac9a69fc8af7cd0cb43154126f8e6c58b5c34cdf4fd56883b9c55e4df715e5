This is the prosodic bestiary. Here, we post illustrations of intonational tunes and other aspects of prosody, and also links to data sets. The idea is to provide public data sets that can be used for further research and teaching. You can listen to our first data set using the interactive plots you find in the posts below.

<ul>
  <li>Ancient Bestiaries, or compendium of beasts, often mixed real animals with ones that we know were imaginary today</li>
  <li>The illustration is an illustration of a Monoceros, a mythical creature with unicorn head and the body of a horse (from the Bodleian Library MS. Bodl. 764)

  <img style="float:right;width:230px;" src="/lab/assets/images/2021/06/unicorn.png" /></a></li>
  <li>A famous recent Bestiary is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Imaginary_Beings">Book of Imaginary Beings</a> by Jorge Luis Borges and Margarita Guerrero</li>
  <li>Our current current understanding of the inventory of intonational tunes may also still be a preliminary compendium</li>
  <li>â€¦and may also mix real creatures with chimeras</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of making data sets publicly accessible is that it will help us better understand the inventory of tunes in English an other languages. We hope to add more data sets and more interactive pages soon.</p>
