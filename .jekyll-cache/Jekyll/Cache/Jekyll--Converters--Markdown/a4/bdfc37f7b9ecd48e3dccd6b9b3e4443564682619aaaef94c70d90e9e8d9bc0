<p>Extended Deadline: 16th of April, 2010</p>

<p><em>The Phonlex project (From Phonology to the Lexicon: liaison and cognition in<br />
contemporary French) brings together 4 linguistic and psycholinguistic<br />
research teams in Toulouse, Grenoble and Paris. These teams have been<br />
investigating various dimensions of French liaison: phonological and<br />
phonetic aspects, regional variation, the synchronic and diachronic<br />
dimension, oral developmental issues as well as liaison in written production.<br />
These topics will constitute the core of our conference. However, French<br />
liaison is not an isolated sandhi phenomenon within the languages of the<br />
world and we therefore welcome papers which discuss the wider issue of<br />
word-segmentation and adjustments at word-boundaries.</em></p>
