There is an interesting series of articles in the new york times on the benefits and dangers of using large-scale corpora and statistical methods in the analysis of literary and other texts in the humanities. [The first](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/arts/17digital.html) discusses some projects that are part of the [digging-into-data challenge](http://prosodylab.org/?p=1). [The second article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/books/04victorian.html) illustrates what race horses with conspicuous names can teach us about the pitfalls of the new windfall of data (hat-tip to Kate McCurdy).
