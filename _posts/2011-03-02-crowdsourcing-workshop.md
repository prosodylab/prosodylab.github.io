Talking about crowdsourcing, this looks like it's going to be an interesting workshop at [this years LSA institute](http://verbs.colorado.edu/LSA2011/):

_Full Title: Crowdsourcing Technologies for Language and Cognition_

Date: 27-Jul-2011 - 27-Jul-2011  
Location: Boulder, Colorado, USA  
Contact Person: Robert Munro  
Web Site: http://www.crowdscientist.com/workshop/

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2011

Meeting Description:

This workshop will bring together linguists who are utilizing crowdsourcing technologies and those who want to know more about them. It combines a half-day 'how-to' session where participants will learn to conduct experiments using crowdsourcing platforms and a half-day workshop where researchers come together to share results, ideas, and strategies.

It is being held in conjunction with the 2011 LSA Summer Institute.

Call for Papers:

We are eliciting abstract submissions for afternoon presentations. They should present either:

a) Novel empirical results in linguistics or the language sciences that have been enabled by internet-based crowdsourcing technologies, or b) novel approaches to data collection and evaluation, especially when there are no 'correct' responses to a given stimuli. Crowdsourcing technologies could include technologies like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, CrowdFlower, online games, collaborative platforms like instant messaging and Wikipedia, or custom software built for collecting language and cognition data. Talk slots will be 10-15 minutes, depending on scheduling.

Please send 250-word abstracts to crowdscientistgmail.com by March 1st, 2011. Do not include author names or affiliations in the abstracts as reviewing will be blind (but list the authors and affiliations in the email itself). Abstracts can be in plain text or PDF. You may optionally include figures, tables and/or references. They will not count towards the 250 words, but please limit the entire submission to one page.
