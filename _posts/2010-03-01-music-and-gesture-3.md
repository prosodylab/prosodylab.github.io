This weekend, the [third conference on music and gesture](http://www.idmil.org/mg3) will take place in Montreal this coming Friday and Saturday. Marcin Swoboda and I will be presenting on _Encoding emotion: how performers manipulate tempo locally to convey affect_.

The conference forms part of the [musimars music festival](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/musimars/mm2010/theme.html), organized this year under the theme 'gestural music--musical gesture.' All throughout this week, there will be concerts and lectures at the [Schulich School of Music](http://www.mcgill.ca/music/).
