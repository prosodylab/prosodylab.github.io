[Phonlex 2010](http://phonlex.free.fr/)

Extended Deadline: 16th of April, 2010

_The Phonlex project (From Phonology to the Lexicon: liaison and cognition in  
contemporary French) brings together 4 linguistic and psycholinguistic  
research teams in Toulouse, Grenoble and Paris. These teams have been  
investigating various dimensions of French liaison: phonological and  
phonetic aspects, regional variation, the synchronic and diachronic  
dimension, oral developmental issues as well as liaison in written production.  
These topics will constitute the core of our conference. However, French  
liaison is not an isolated sandhi phenomenon within the languages of the  
world and we therefore welcome papers which discuss the wider issue of  
word-segmentation and adjustments at word-boundaries._
