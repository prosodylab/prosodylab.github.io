[This](http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~amelinge/Workshop/index.html) looks like it's going to be an interesting event, conveniently scheduled right before [AMLaP](http://prosodylab.org/?p=363) at York University:

_The School of Psychology at The University of Dundee and the Department of Psychology at The University of Edinburgh are pleased to announce the [6th International Workshop on Language Production](http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~amelinge/Workshop/index.html). The workshop is dedicated to fostering an interdisciplinary approach to language production research by including work in areas such as psycholinguistics, cognitive neuropsychology, linguistics, computational modelling, and neuroimaging. It will be organized around tutorial-like talks intended to provide a review of research questions and stimulate discussion. The workshop program also includes poster sessions to offer graduate students and others the opportunity to showcase their most recent findings._

Location: Edinburgh  
Date: September 2-4, 2010

Deadline for Poster Submission: June 1, 2010
