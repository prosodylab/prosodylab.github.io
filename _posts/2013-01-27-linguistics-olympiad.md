This year, we are once again organizing a session of the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad, to be held at McGill on January 31. This is a fun competition that is a great way for us get some high school and cegep students (up to 12th grade) exposed to the field of linguistics. If you know of anyone who'd be interested, please forward this message.

Participation is free. No previous knowledge is required. More information and many practice problems are posted at the [naclo website](http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/).

If you know any students at high schools or cegeps in the Montr√©al area who might be interested, please forward them this information. Students can register online until January 30 at 3pm, and we also accept walk-ins on the day of the contest.

The first round of the contest will take place on Thursday, Januar 31, from 10am to 1pm at McGill University (sign in starting at 9:15am; directions can be found at our website (see below). Students who perform well on the first round will be invited back for a second round, to take place on March 13. The winners of the invitational round will be eligible to represent North America at the International Linguistics Olympiad.

Check out the [McGill Website](http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/events/upcoming-events/olympiad-2013) for more information, or contact us at naclo.montreal@gmail.com.

Note: Currently the North American Olympiad is only held in English. If you are interested in developing materials in French for future years, we can put you in touch with the organizers of NACLO, who expressed interest in trying to make materials available in French as well.
