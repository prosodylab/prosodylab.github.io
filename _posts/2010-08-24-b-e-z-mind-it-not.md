In case anyone is still worried that texting abbreviations are a sign that the English language is deteriorating they should have a look at the [article in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/aug/18/british-library-textspeak-exhibition) a few days ago about an upcoming [exhibition on language](http://www.bl.uk/evolvingenglish/) at the British Library in London, which provides evidence that these abbreviations are actually a time-honored tradition of playful language/orthography use. Among other things the exhibition revisits the history of language [peevery](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1354), it seems, with such landmarks as Jonathan Swift's [A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/proposal.html). One of the many grievances Jonathan Swift had with his fellow English users was _that barbarous Custom of abbreviating Words_. Swift would surely not have been amused by the poetic use of things like "I wrote 2U B4" in an 19th century poem the exhibition features. Anatol Stefanowitsch, whose [blog](http://www.wissenslogs.de/wblogs/blog/sprachlog) post pointed me to this, dug up the complete poem referred to in the article, [Essay to Miss Catharine Jay](http://www.wissenslogs.de/wblogs/blog/sprachlog/sprachgebrauch/2010-08-22/sms-k-rzel-im-19.-jahrhundert), as it was published in 1847. Some of the 'emblems' are not easy to resolve, have a look... The one that Anatol is wondering about in his post is 'The girl without a parallel' as a girl without a parallel pointed out to me.
