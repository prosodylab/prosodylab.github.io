The deadline for [Mosaic 2](http://mosaic2.wordpress.com/) was extended. Monday is the final day to submit a paper!

Mosaic is a workshop bringing together semanticists active in Canada. It's a satellite meeting of the annual meeting of the [Canadian Linguistic Association.](http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cla-acl/)
