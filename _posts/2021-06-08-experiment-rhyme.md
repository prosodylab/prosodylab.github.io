Some rhymes sound better than others, and some attempts at rhymes don't seem to be rhymes at all. Our lab studies constraints on rhyming, and this experiment explores a particular one. 

* You can check out the experiment [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/public/rhyme/?mode=testExperiment) (no data will be saved) 
* Or you can participate for real (no compensation) [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/public/rhyme/) (your data will be saved)
