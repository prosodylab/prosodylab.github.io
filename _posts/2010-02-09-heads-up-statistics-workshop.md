Statistics Workshop on Logit Mixed Models, May 3-4 2010 at McGill

The [gripp reading group](http://prosodylab.org/labblog/?page_id=116) and the [CRLMB](http://www.crlmb.ca/) are organzing a statistics workshop on logit mixed models. [Florian Jaeger](http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/fjaeger/) (University of Rochester) and his lab will give several tutorials on this and related topics on May 3 and 4 (we might have a 3rd day though). The workshop is co-sponsored by the CRLMB, prosody.lab, the [Mcgill Infant Development Cluster](http://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/midccdem/), and the PoP lab, and is organized by [Aparna Nadig](http://www.mcgill.ca/scsd/people/faculty/aparnanadig/), [Kris Onishi](http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/faculty/onishi.html) and me.

Further information will be posted in early March. Hope to see you there!
