The book with papers from the 2007 conference on alternatives to cartography in Brussels (edited by Jeroen van Cranenbroeck) was just [published](http://www.degruyter.com/cont/imp/mouton/detail.cfm?isbn=9783110206036&sel=det). A pre-print of my article [Focus, Topic, Word Order: A Compositional Approach](http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/mYyNDQ5Z/abstract.html) is posted on the [semantics archive.](http://semanticsarchive.net)
