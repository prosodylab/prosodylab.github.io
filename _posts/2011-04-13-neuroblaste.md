Just came across 'neuroblaste', Radio Canada's pretty awsome animated series about good old neuroscience in Montr√©al... you know, the [MKULTRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKULTRA)-type of research, that you may have encountered in your ethics training on experiments with human subjects (the show is in French):

If you're in Canada, you can watch all episodes [here](http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/neuroblaste/episode1.shtml).
