For those of you who are interested in using the[Prosodylab Aligner](http://prosodylab.org/tools/aligner/) and are new to using Unix and/or Terminal on your computer, we've started making a series of video tutorials to show you how to use this software on your own. The videos will cover some basics and not-so-basics, from how to run the Aligner through Terminal to how to clean and prepare your data for training the Aligner on new models.

First in the series is an intro to the Aligner: what is it, what does it do, and how can you run it?
