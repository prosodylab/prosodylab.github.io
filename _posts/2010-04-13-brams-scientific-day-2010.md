This looks pretty interesting: [Brams scientific day](http://www.brams.org/events/brams-annual-scientific-day-1/scientific-day-2010)

_BRAMS is pleased to announce a full-day symposium on Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience. This event will double as the 2010 BRAMS Scientific Day, and will be held on April 16th 2010. The symposium will be held one day before the Cognitive Neuroscience Society meeting in the Jeanne Timmins auditorium of the Montreal Neurological Institute._

[Brams](http://www.brams.org/) is the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research. Prosody.lab is currently running a study on Euroopean and Québec French in their [fancy lab-space](http://www.brams.org/about/benefits) over at Université de Montréal.
