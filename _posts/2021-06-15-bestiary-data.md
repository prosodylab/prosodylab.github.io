After sharing in an ad hoc way since we first presented it, we now released the data from our original bestiary paper on GIT/OSF:

Wagner, M. and Goodhue, D. (2021). Toward a bestiary of English intonational tunes: Data. OSF Project.  [[doi]](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/H8DYA) [[git]](https://github.com/prosodylab/bestiary-risingcontours/tree/master)
