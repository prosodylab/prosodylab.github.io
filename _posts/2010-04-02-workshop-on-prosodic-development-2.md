The program of the [workshop on prosodic development](http://prosodia.upf.edu/activitats/prosodicdevelopment/home/), organized by [Pilar Prieto](http://prosodia.upf.edu/membres/pilarprieto/) is now available [online](http://prosodia.upf.edu/activitats/prosodicdevelopment/home/program.php).

_The main goal of this one-day workshop is to discuss different aspects of the children's prosodic development in different languages. Discussions will address specific questions regarding the influence of language-specific distributional and frequency properties on language development and also the influence of general production and perception constraints. One of the goals will be to try to bridge the gap between perception and production studies in prosodic development._
