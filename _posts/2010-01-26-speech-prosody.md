[Speech Prosody](http://speechprosody2010.illinois.edu/) will take place in Chicago this year. There's a special session on [Experimental Approaches to Focus](http://speechprosody2010.illinois.edu/focus.php), organized by [Yi Xu](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/yi/) which promises to be interesting.

prosodylab will be represented at speech prosody with two posters in the main session. drop me an email if you're interested in the drafts:

M. Wagner, M. Breen, E. Flemming, S. Shattuck-Hufnagel, & E. Gibson: Prosodic Effects of Discourse Salience and Association with Focus.

_Abtract: Three factors that have been argued to influence the prosody of  
an utterance are (i) which constituents encode discourse-salient  
information; (ii) which constituents are contrastive in that they  
evoke alternatives; and (iii) which constituents interact with  
the meaning of focus operators such as only (i.e., they ‘associate’  
with focus). One challenge for a better understanding of  
these factors has been the difficulty of finding a way to evaluate  
hypotheses quantitatively, since individual variation in productions  
is often large enough to wash out experimental effects.  
In this paper, we apply a methodology introduced in [1] which  
regresses out subject and item variation, uncovering otherwise  
hidden prosodic patterns that illustrate how the three factors interact  
in sentences containing single or multiple foci._

Wagner, Michael & Serena Crivellaro: Relative Prosodic Boundary Strength and Prior Bias in Disambiguation

_Abstract: Previous research found that the relative rather than the absolute  
size of prosodic boundaries is crucial in disambiguating  
attachment ambiguities [1, 2]. Furthermore, relative categorical  
differences matter whereas merely quantitative ones do not  
[1]. This paper presents further evidence that relative boundary  
strength is indeed what is crucial, but, contrary to earlier findings,  
gradient quantitative differences in boundary rank affect  
parsing decisions in gradient ways. Furthermore, varying the  
plausibility of a given reading in a given context shifts the perceptual  
boundaries between different phrasings such that quantitatively  
stronger prosodic cues are necessary to counter-act a  
prior bias against it._
