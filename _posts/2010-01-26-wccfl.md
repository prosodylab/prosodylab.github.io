The [WCCFL](http://www.wccfl2010.org/home.htm) program has been posted. There's lots of interesting papers on prosody on the program, including some from [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/): by David-Etienne Bouchard (on clitic in French), Öner Öçelik and Miho Nagai (Syntax-Prosody in Turkish), Hyekyung Hwang, Moti Lieberman, [Heather Goad](http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/people/goad/), & [Lydia White](http://webpages.mcgill.ca/staff/group2/lwhite/web/) (on prosodic diambiguation), Walter Pederson (on 'again'), and yet another one by Heather Goad and Lydia White (on prosodic transfer).
