[Radiolab](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/)'s interesting [current podcast](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2010/09/10) is about language. Radiolab is a great radio show about science, and it differs from your typical media outlet on science in that its topics are often drawn from cognitive science. I can think of a bunch of questions relating to the strong claims made in the show about how relevant language is to perform various cognitive tasks, but the research the show reports on is fascinating. See also the additional video that comes with the podcast, also featured on the [language log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2543), including some nice footage of [Taughannock Falls](http://www.taughannock.com/):
