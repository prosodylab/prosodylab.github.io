There have been two interesting blog posts on scientific literacy recently on the [bps digest](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com). [The first](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/10/five-minutes-with-discoverer-of.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BpsResearchDigest+%28BPS+Research+Digest%29) addresses how to present findings in ways that minimizes a 'scientific impotence response,' where people discard scientific findings because they are incompatible with their world view by resorting to claiming that a certain topic cannot be properly studied scientifically. [The second](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/11/can-psychology-help-combat.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BpsResearchDigest+%28BPS+Research+Digest%29) post discusses how one can try to present findings effectively in order to debunk pseudo-scientific beliefs.
