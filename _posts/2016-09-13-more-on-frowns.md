A while ago, I [posted on two competing meanings of &nbsp;'frown'](http://prosodylab.org/2010/frown/)&nbsp;here. Just recently, [Lynne Murphy](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/115259) &nbsp;at [separated by a common language](http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.ca/)&nbsp;followed up on this with this [post](http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.ca/2016/09/frowns.html), which generated some interesting responses.

Most spectacularly, it prompted the following confirmation that British vs. American English distinction indeed has something to do with it (even though I didn't find consistent intuitions among the (few) people from the two sides of Atlantic that I informally asked about it at the time): &nbsp;[Josef Fruehwald](https://jofrhwld.github.io/)&nbsp;observed the following amazing difference in the the respective sign languages (British vs. American) on Twitter:

The earliest reference someone posted in the [comments section](http://prosodylab.org/2010/frown/) of the downward-facing smile reading so far dates to the 1930s--any earlier occurrences anyone?
