Tomorrow at the LSA Meeting in Portland, there'll be a tutorial on _[LingSync and ProsodyLab-Aligner: Tools for Linguistic Fieldwork and Experimentation](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/session/tutorial-lingsync-and-prosodylab-aligner-tools-linguistic-fieldwork-and-experimentation)_. If you plan on attending and would like to try out the Prosodylab-Aligner while being there, you should try to install the aligner beforehand. You'll find it here:

[Prosodylab-Aligner](https://github.com/prosodylab/Prosodylab-Aligner)

The aligner has just undergone some revisions, and we currently only have installation instructions for the new aligner for Mac users:

[Prosdoylab-Aligner: Installation Instructions for Mac Users](http://cslu.ohsu.edu/~gormanky/aligner/aligner-tutorial-startup.html)

Please keep tuned for updates in the coming week, since we're still finalizing the documentation of the new features and changes. In the meantime, if you'd like to use the old aligner (compatible with the video tutorial below), then you can still install that here:

[Prosodylab-Aligner, Previous Version](https://github.com/kylebgorman/Prosodylab-Aligner/archive/2204ee08a14ab91007155a09423da1d81d4be420.zip)
