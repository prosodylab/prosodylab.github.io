 **Workshop on Mixed Models on May 3rd and May 4th 2010**

**[The slides from the workshop are now posted on [Florian's blog](http://wiki.bcs.rochester.edu:2525/HlpLab/StatsCourses). Thanks everyone who participated for making this an interesting event!]**

The [gripp](http://prosodylab.org/?page_id=116) reading group at McGill and the [CRLMB](http://www.crlmb.ca/) are organizing a statistics workshop on logit mixed models.

The workshop will feature lectures and tutorials on ordinary and multilevel/mixed models by [Florian Jaeger](http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/fjaeger/) (University of Rochester), [Maureen Gillespie](http://www.psych.neu.edu/people/students/gillespie.html) (Northeastern), and [Peter Graff](http://web.mit.edu/graff/www/) (MIT).

Sponsors: CRLMB, prosody.lab, the Mcgill Infant  
Development Cluster, the PoP lab, the Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience  
training grant, Digging into Data (SSHRC/NSF), and BRAMS.

The workshop will take place at McGill. The precise schedule is still to  
be determined, the current plan looks like this:

**Monday**

Introduction to Generalized Linear and Generalized Linear Mixed Models  
(Florian Jaeger)

1-2  
Lunch (provided for registered participants)

There will be a party, probably on the evening Monday May 3rd. There

If you are interested in participating, please register [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEM1MUVWUDBjdlVjU0NBVmF6a1ZOYkE6MQ).

Registration will be first-come-first-served, but priority will be given  
to members of the sponsoring labs and institutions. We'll try to  
accommodate everyone, but the earlier you register the better!

We'll send more detailed information to all registered people closer to  
the workshop. You can bring your own laptop with R installed  
(instructions how to do this and which packages you will need will be  
sent out before the workshop).

If you have any questions, please send an email here, or contact one of  
the organizers:

Hope to see you there!
