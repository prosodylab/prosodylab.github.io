The next [International Seminar on Speech Production](http://www.issp2011.uqam.ca) will take place next summer in Montreal. Here's the call for papers:

_We are pleased to announce that the the ninth International Seminar on Speech Production (ISSP'11) will be held in Montreal, Canada from June 20th to 23rd, 2011. ISSPâ€™11 is the continuation of a series of seminars dating back to Grenoble (1988), Leeds (1990), Old Saybrook (1993), Autrans (1996), Kloster Seeon (2000), Sydney (2003), Ubatuba (2006), and Strasbourg (2008). Several aspects of speech production will be covered, such as phonology, phonetics, linguistics, mechanics, acoustics, physiology, motor control, neurosciences and computer science._

For this edition, a special session will be organized in honor of Dr. Joseph Perkell, for his contribution to the field.

THE DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION IS December 15th, 2010. Technical details will be posted soon on the conference website ([www.issp2011.uqam.ca](http://www.issp2011.uqam.ca)).
