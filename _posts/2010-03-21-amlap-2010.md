_[AMLaP](http://www.psycholinguistics.com/amlap) is an international conference which has established itself as the premier European venue for interdisciplinary research into how people process language. The aim of the conference is to bring together psychological, computational, and theoretical perspectives on the cognitive mechanisms which underlie any aspect of human language processing. Submissions which integrate experimental psycholinguistic evidence with formal or computational models of psychological processes are especially encouraged._

6th - 8th September 2010, York, UK

Submission Dates: Abstract submission will open May 1st. Abstracts due by May 28th.
