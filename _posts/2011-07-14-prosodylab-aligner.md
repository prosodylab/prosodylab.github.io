The [Prosodylab-Aligner](http://prosodylab.org/tools/aligner/) is a set of Python and shell scripts for performing automated alignment of text to audio of speech using Hidden Markov Models developed in our lab by [Kyle Gorman](http://ling.upenn.edu/~kgorman/). It is designed to be easy to use as possible, and with laboratory data in mind. While it ships with pre-trained North American English phoneme models based on data collected in our lab, it also supports training on arbitrary data.
