Wagner, Michael (2021). Why predictability is not predictive without a linguistic theory and a theory of processing. The case of external sandhi. Talk presented at Universit√§t des Saarlandes, July 15 2021. Reporting on joint work with [Oriana Kilbourn-Ceron](https://orianakilbournceron.com/) and others [[slides]](http://prosodylab.org/~chael/papers/wagner21predictability.pdf)

*(I updated the title after the talk to add 'and a theory of processing' to better reflect the content)*
